		<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Maharashtra Institute of Technology College of Engineering (MITCOE), Kothrud</h2>
<hr>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Location:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Though not in the heart of Pune, MIT College of Engineering (MITCOE), Kothrud has very very good accessibility. There are special buses for MIT from Katraj, as well as a few other places. But the 10 minute walk from bus-stop to college becomes tiresome after some time. Nevertheless, getting to the college is not very hard, even if you don’t have your own vehicle. But again, in over 50% of the students have their own bikes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Infrastructure:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Campus is huge but all of it is not only for MITCOE students. It is shared with many management, engineering &amp; other colleges run by same trust. The building and the campus of certainly look grand, and the classes are well furnished and equipped from the inside too. With the kind of facilities provided, the students are bound to be satisfied, but one thing is an issue here. All the computers in the laboratories, have updates software, but just that the hardware is a little slow. The library is just about okay, with sufficient books,&nbsp; and so is the availability of reference books, much needed for the various engineering topics students want to dive in deeper, than normal scope of syllabus. Internet is available in the comp labs, and the speed is pretty decent too. The entire college is rigged with CCTV cameras to keep a watch on students.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Fees:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At MITCOE, the fees are about Rs.79,000 per year.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Faculty:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The faculty, the senior teaching staff is just superb. No one even okay, all are good, very good. The issue here is that the number of senior profs is less, and junior faculty is more. The students complain of the junior profs being egoistic, and ignorant. Faculty for FE is amazing and some are common with MIT. For higher years it's mixed bag. Mech has strict teachers while comps &amp; IT has very lenient ones. Also, students say that the mid term tests depend upon the teachers, so its not a problem even if you don't clear them. And at times, the answer sheets have not even been returned to the students. So pretty relaxed with that.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Attendance:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The college has recently become strict when it comes to the attendance norm. 75% is a bare minimum set by the university, for successful completion of terms. Failing which, say upto 50% students can escape with a fine and a few extra assignments. But for anything under 40% be ready to call for trouble (read getting detained for a year). The fine could be anywhere around Rs.5,000 or call up parents.<br> <strong>Note</strong>: Mondays and Thursdays students are expected to wear uniforms.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Crowd:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The crowd here is not as good as you would find in MIT, but it's not bad either. The majority of crowd is Marathi speaking. There is also a decent number of students who don't understand Marathi. This at times becomes a problem as they don't follow what the teacher is speaking. Overall the crowd is very diverse as everyone from all different colleges on campus come and mingle with others. Almost everyone is friendly and amiable.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Hangouts:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The cold coffee at the nearby Durga café is famous throughout Pune, and for good reason. Also grilled sandwiches of Richie Rich &amp; rolls at Faaso's are a must try. Other hangouts are adjacent hillocks or 'tekdis', FC road, JM road, City Pride mall, and the ‘tapris’ around MIT.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Canteen:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The college canteen is very small, but the presence of other canteens around makes up for it. And there's one common canteen which is quite spacious and serves a variety of food. Although the numbers of students is large, you can manage to find nice space with your friends. The food is good, but a little bit on the expensive side. Cold coffee is a must try here, although its slightly expensive than the one available outside the campus. Chandralok is the biggest canteen, which is good too.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Festivals:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Maharashtra Institute of Technology (MIT) hosts a massive national level sports festival called Summit every year. The technical festivals are called Tesla, Axlerate and Intechxication. The cultural fest, Udhaan, is held in the first week of February.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Placements:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The placements have been good here and companies flock in by the reputation of being an MIT institute. Around 75% of all students or almost 100% of the eligible ones get placed every year. Infosys, TCS Wipro are the bulk recruiters, with salaries averaging at 3.5 - 5 Lakh per annum. Core recruiters include John Deere, Tata Motors, Kirloskar Engines, Thermax Solutions, Volkswagon etc. The highest placement has gone upto Rs. 12 - 13 Lakh. Not bad, but nothing really significant.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Verdict:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As this is not 'THE MIT'...it's MITCOE. Not among top 3 colleges in Pune, but it's certainly among top 10. Not a bad choice if you can't make it to either of the top 3 colleges and you also don't want to travel too far to the outskirts.</p>
