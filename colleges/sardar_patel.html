<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #4f8335;"><strong><em>NOTE: Sardar Patel College of Engineering (SPCE) is an <a title="Read more about Deemed Universities &amp; Autonomous Colleges" href="http://www.stupidsid.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1270&amp;Itemid=282" target="_blank">autonomous</a> institute affiliated to the University of Mumbai</em></strong></span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Location:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sardar Patel College of Engineering (SPCE) is a 15 minute ride by rick from Andheri railway station (W. Rly. &amp; Harbour Rly.) and shares the same campus with the very famous Bhavans college. Due to the ongoing Metro work since the last few years, the roads are in dilapidated condition and don't be surprised if the <em>autowallahs</em> blatantly refuse to ferry you to the college. BEST buses to the college are equally unmotivating. Students who travel by train, most of the times, prefer to walk while &nbsp;a few opt for the share rickshaw on the SV Road.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Infrastructure:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Infrastructure is decent. Campus is one of the largest amongst the engineering colleges in Mumbai. Lack of ACs might pull it down a bit but the natural environment is a plus point. Sardar Patel College of Engineering (SPCE) building might look old but they have the best infrastructure with reference to labs &amp; workshops. Classrooms are average while washrooms are not very clean. Library is very much equipped with truckload of books.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The campus also has a hostel facility considering it hosts two engineering, one management and a degree college respectively.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Fees:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Rs. 24,000/- per year</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Faculty:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The faculty at Sardar Patel College of Engineering is decent. They have enough knowledge about the subject to teach and clear your doubts, if any. Not very strict. Students from the reservation backgorund find the teachers extremely helpful as apart from academics, they do help in solving their personal problems.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Attendance:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Attendance is not too strict either. A minimum of 60% of attendance in all subjects is recommended but don't worry if you can't satisfy the critiera. Test marks carry more weight-age over the attendance. But with the crowd that you find in the college, most often you end up attending lectures.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Crowd:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Being one of the top rated colleges in Mumbai, SPCE has a very studious crowd. Definitely you will meet many nerds and geeks. A bunch of cream crowd can also be expected followed by students from the reserved category. Eventhough it is located in the western suburbs and has a 'not-so-accessible' location, students from every possible nook and corner of the city are seen here. Good fun loving life. "<em>Khao, Piyo, aur Aish Karo</em>", quotes a student.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Canteen:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The canteen is pretty big as compared to other colleges, but with 7 branches (SPCE and SPIT combined), it seems a little small. The menu is good ranging from punjabi to chinese to Indian to South Indian. There is a sandwich counter as well. The menu is decently priced. Apart from the canteen, great snacks are available right outside the campus and franky, boy!.. that's a hot favourite among the students.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Hangouts:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On Campus: Quadrangle and Katta at SPIT entrance, Bhavanâ€™s ground, Auditorium, Amphitheatre, Lake (Boating Facility use to be Available!!) and you can spot a lot of interesting insects around.</p>
