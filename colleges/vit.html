However, unlike other autonomous institutes in the state, it is part of CAP and not CAPAI.</strong></em></span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Location:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Vishwakarma Institute of Technology (VIT) has a good location in terms of accessibility, but not in terms of locality. It is located in Bibvewadi, towards the southern extreme of Pune and is a 5-7 minute climb from the main road where the PMT buses drop you. The approach road makes you feel like you're on a pilgrimage, climbing your way to the temple for '<em>darshan</em>' with colourful shops lined up on both sides of the road selling general stuff instead of flowers and sweets.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Infrastructure:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When you've heard of VIT so much, you'd expect a gigantic campus with lush green lawns, a wonderful stone structure and enough open space to organize a big Rock concert. But unfortunately, the campus disappoints on all such factors. Now that doesn't mean the infrastructure is bad in anyway, it's up-to-date and definitely acceptable, just that if your expectations are high, you would feel that it isn't really up to the mark and there is a good scope for improvisation. The library is good,&nbsp; air-conditioned and Wi-Fi enabled, classrooms are roomy and spacious as well and once you get used to the college, you'll know there's hardly anything missing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Fees:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Rs. 86,250/ year</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Faculty :</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Amazing! Overall, the students are quite satisfied with the faculty, and they say that all professors have good communication skills. The faculty is specially renowned for Mechanical and E&amp;TC. And except for the Computers department (which slightly falls behind) the faculty is appreciable in all other departments as well.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Attendance :</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Vishwakarma Institute of Technology (VIT) is very strict in terms of attendance. 70-75% is considered okay, but anything below this, and you have to pay a heavy fine, and may even be detained.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><br> Crowd:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The crowd is united, and exhibit good teamwork, and discipline. The college is good for extracurriculars, and has good support for sports. High cutoffs mean you'll be meeting a lot of top scorers and rankers here, but not necessarily only nerds as the crowd shows great interest in music, sports &amp; entertainment as well.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Hangouts :</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There's nothing really close to the college worth paying a visit. Students can mostly be found at any of the hangouts like Sufi, cyber cafe, Kalyan bhel, or City pride at Satara road.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><br> Canteen:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Canteen is very okay, and the students say that the quality has come down considerably. Quantity is low, when you take the prices into account. At least it's spacious.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Festivals:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Vishwakarma Institute of Technology (VIT) hosts its technical fest called Melange towards the end of January. The Sports fest, Vishwakarandak, is held in December.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Placements:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Superb! The college offers a healthy 85-90% placements overall with most of the remaining opting out of placements as they wish to pursue higher studies. Forbes Marshall, Fiat, Tata motors, Infosys are some of the major recruiters, with average package being around Rs. 4 lac. Computers, Electronics &amp; E&amp;TC record the best placements with many students getting multiple job offers as well. Salaries as high as 10-15 lakh per year have also been offered to a few.</p>
