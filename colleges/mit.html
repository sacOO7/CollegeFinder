		<h2>Maharashtra Institute of Technology (MIT), Kothrud</h2>
<hr>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Location:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Though not in the heart of Pune, Maharashtra Institute of Technology (MIT), Kothrud has pretty good accessibility. Numerous PMT buses drop you at the main road from where the college is a pleasant 800-metre walk (pleasant because the entire road has trees on both sides and thus it's never too hot, even in summers. And even if you do have to face problems travelling to MIT, it's still worth the pain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Infrastructure:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The majestic entrance invites you to the mammoth MIT campus which feels like a small township in itself. MIT School of Management, MIT School of Business, MIT College of Pharmacy, MITCOE and many other MIT Colleges are part of the same campus as Maharashtra Institute of Technology (MIT). The infrastructure is top notch. Classrooms are airy, labs are excellent and well-equipped. The library is MASSIVE! There are gardens and lawns, football fields, basketball &amp; volleyball courts, space &amp; facilities for indoor games, you name it!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Fees:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Rs. 92,000/ year</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Faculty:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Students say the faculty is really good. There are learned senior professors, specially in the mechanical department which is said to be the BEST in Pune after COEP or may be even equally good. The other departments have excellent professors as well.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Attendance:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Maharashtra Institute of Technology (MIT) is rather strict about attendance issues, and fines are levied on students who don’t manage to keep their attendance records high. Students with attendance in the range of 60 to 75% have to cough up a Rs. 200/- fine, those with below 60% have to pay a Rs. 500/- fine, and those having below 40% attendance are often detained.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Crowd:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The MIT campus has so many different colleges that the overall crowd is bound to be a wonderful mix. They have a good cosmopolitan crowd. The environment is good and decently multicultural. MIT, in particular, being amongst the top colleges not only in Pune, but all over the country, invites top scorers, smart chaps and one of the most brilliant minds. Additionally there are all kinds of people here; technically inclined nerds, geeks, rock-music lovers, sports enthusiasts, guitar players, hot girls, English-speaking guys ;) and a few villagers as well.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Hangouts:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The cold coffee at the nearby Durga café is famous throughout Pune, and for good reason. Other hangouts are FC road, JM road, City Pride mall, and the ‘tapris’ around MIT. Richie Rich's Ice Tea (priced at just Rs. 10!) and Veg Cheese Overload Grilled sandwich are a must try here.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Canteen:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It's rather expensive for a college, with even a sada dosa costing you as much as 35! However, they say that the Punjabi thali is a must-have. The canteen is sufficiently big with enough seating arrangements and good ventilation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Festivals:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Maharashtra Institute of Technology (MIT) hosts a massive national level sports festival called Summit every year. The technical festivals are called Axlerate and Intechxication. The cultural fest, Udhaan, is held in the first week of February.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Placements:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The usual suspects (Infosys, TCS) grab students in numbers, but MIT also has Microsoft and Deloitte picking up a few students. Global leader Shell recruits Petroleum students in bulk too. MIT offers nearly 100% placements.</p>
