<hr>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Location:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Pune Institute of Computer Technology (PICT), is located in Dhankawadi right next to the rear gate of the Bharati Vidyapeeth campus in South Pune's Katraj area. It is quite easily accessible and has a good strategic location. The only problem could perhaps be that it's really far from the central Pune and students travelling from Northern or eastern parts of the city may have to spend long hours reaching the college.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Infrastructure:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The premises are sufficiently big to be called a "college campus" and there's a very beautiful and lush green lawn right as you step inside the college gate. The building too appears quite pleasing and it said to host 'the best library amongst all the colleges under Pune University’ as quoted by a group of students. Pune Institute of Computer Technology (PICT) unlike most other engineering colleges in Pune has few streams on offer and thus the labs are very well maintained. The college has provision for internet in the labs. The classrooms and benches are well kept but they somewhat make you feel that you are in a school.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Fees:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Rs. 77,936/ year</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Faculty:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Pune Institute of Computer Technology (PICT) has a very good faculty majority of them having great knowledge about the subject. The results of the students depict this explicitly. Communication could be a problem with some of the teachers, but on the whole, SUPERB teachers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Attendance:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">VERY VERY STRICT. The only people seen during lecture hours are some of the faculty who are moving from one classroom to the other and the watchmen. The remaining, i.e., all the students, are inside the classrooms. The students are asked to maintain a <strong>100%</strong> attendance, a fine of Rs. 100/- is levied for every bunked lecture. Term work too gets affected due to lack of attendance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Crowd:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most of the students are study oriented. It feels as if their only aim in life is to score higher than their colleagues.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Hangouts:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A chain of food stalls right in front of PICT's gate provide a variety of delicious foods. A CCD next to these food stalls offers a nice ambience for budding relationships. Bhagyalakshmi’s panipuri is not to be missed. City pride multiplex on Pune-Satara road is about 4-5 kms from the college.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Canteen:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Useless” says one student. Though its cheap, the food literally sucks! Dabba is must or you can opt for any of the food stalls outside the college.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Festivals:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Pune Institute of Computer Technology (PICT) celebrates its Techfests—Inc. in March; &amp; Credence in September. The Cultural festivals are Addiction and Abhivyakti which are also celebrated sometime in September.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Placements:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Excellent; 2<sup>nd</sup> best after COEP. Google, Microsoft and IBM come here every year. TCS, Infy, Accenture recruit the major chunk. Average salary must be around Rs. 4 lakhs/per year. If you're at Pune Institute of Computer Technology (PICT), rest assured, you'll definitely get a job! So all that hard work, attendance, everything finally pays off well.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Verdict:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you get it, take it. Wonderful academics and faculty are a plus point but EXTRA discipline, attendance and lack of extra-curricular activities ruin it! Yet, all said and done, the top notch placements create a change of hearts even amongst students at COEP, who say that may be PICT is slightly better.</p>
