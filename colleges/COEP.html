<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Location:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">College of Engineering, Pune fondly known as COEP requires no landmark, the college itself is a well known place throughout Pune. It is located on the Pune station road in Shivajinagar. Nothing needs to be said about its accessibility, its absolutely fantastic.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Infrastructure:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The campus is never-ending. It stretches on both sides of the main road and can be estimated to be as big as 5 football fields on each side. There are ten buildings in the hostel campus and host about 1000 boys and 400 girls. Fees for the hostel are about Rs. 8000/- per year. Labs are well-equipped.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Placements:</h3>
<p>Probably the best placements amongst all engineering colleges in Pune. 100% placements, or even more than 100% if you consider the multiple offers that some students get. Companies like Google (19.95 lac) IOCL, BPCL, Barclays finance also visit the campus, athough they pick up just a few students. TCS&nbsp; as well other IT companies are the major recruiters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Faculty:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The teaching is very good. English communication is good and the students have a comfortable learning experience. However, the Dean is said to be very strict and reminds one of Viru Sahastrabudhhe (Virus) of the 3 Idiots fame. But not all others are the same “Our director deserves a good amount of appreciation, and we all love him.” quotes a group of students.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Attendance:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Very very strict. 75% is an absolute necessity. Defaulters are detained straightaway, even at 74.9% attendance!!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Crowd:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Crowd at COEP is more study oriented and the students get engrossed in technical matters. They love their college and cannot hear a word against it. But it’s a “ <em>Ladkiyon ka registaan</em>, hardly anyone worth giving a second look” says one student.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Hangouts:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">FC road, JM road for varieties of food and E-Square, Mangla talkies for movies. &nbsp;“Anna ki tapri” is one of the local favourites and many COEP students can be found lingering there. His speciality is that he doesn’t forget your favourite order and serves it to you as soon as he sees you approaching. Lake-side-seating or boating are another option.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Canteen:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The COEP campus hosts 2 canteens one on each side of the road. Cafe house is better than the boat club cafe. Chaat and missal is excellent. Food is decent and affordable.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Festivals:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Zest is the inter college sports festival of College of Engineering, Pune (COEP). It is held in Jan-end. &nbsp;Mindspark is the technical festival which is held in mid-October.</p>
