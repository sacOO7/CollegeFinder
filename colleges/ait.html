<hr>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #4f8335;"><em><strong>Note: This institute allows admissions to wards of army personnel only. Admission is through AIEEE scores. It is mandatory for the First year students to stay in hostel.</strong></em></span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Location:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Army Institute of Technology (AIT) stands as a majestic landmark on the nearly barren road to Alandi in the North-Eastern outskirts of Pune. It's pretty far from well established civilization and is hardly accessible using public transport or PMT buses. Students, thus, prefer to stay in the college hostel than commute to college every day.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Infrastructure:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Excellent campus, makes you feel like you've become a part of the army training, although the courses offered are nothing related to that. The library is air-conditioned. Classrooms are decent and &nbsp;labs are well equipped. Presently AIT has 3 hostels within the campus, two for boys and one for girls. Hostel fees are around Rs. 45,000/- per year. Sports facility for indoor/outdoor sports is also available. A shopping complex exists within the campus to cater for day to day requirements of the inmates like stationery, food, general stores etc.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Fees:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Rs. 1,10,000/- per annum</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Faculty:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Army Institute of Technology (AIT) has very good faculty, with a majority senior professors having many years of teaching experience. The stability of the faculty is also decent. None of the students hold any grudges or complaints against their teachers</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Attendance:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is strict, below 75% a fine ranging from Rs. 50/- to Rs.2000/- is levied based on the amount of lag in the attendance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Crowd:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since the admissions are through AIEEE and not MH CET, the crowd is absolutely varied. Students from all parts of the country come here. Delhi-ites are more. The crowd is fun-loving, friendly and party-type. A game of basketball at night is a favourite for all students.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Hangouts:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There's only long stretches of empty roads and barren lands on either side of the campus and a small village nearby. Very few hangouts nearby, and most of the students prefer to stay on-campus. If you want to linger outside you have to travel a good 8-10 kms (about 45mins by drive) to reach to good parts of the city like MG road, FC road, JM road, Koregaon Park, Kalyani Nagar etc.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Canteen:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are 4-5 canteens, one of which is open 24hrs. No canteen is available in the girls hostel. Food is moderately priced (Sada dosa &nbsp;costs Rs.15/-). The mess food is just about edible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Festivals:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Pace is the sports festival of Army Institute of Technology (AIT) held in the 1<sup>st</sup> week of February. Aakriti is the cultural cum sports festival.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Placements:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Army Institute of Technology (AIT) witnesses above average placements with MNCs like Microsoft picking up about half a dozen students at a whopping 10 lakh package as well. Others get around Rs 3.5 to 4.5L per annum. Major recruiters are Tata Motors, Infosys, IBM, Zensar, Wipro etc. The college easily manages to place over 80% of its students.</p>
