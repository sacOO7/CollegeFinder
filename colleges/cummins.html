		<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Cummins College of Engineering for Women, Karvenagar</h2>
<hr>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Location :</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cummins College of Engineering for Women is located in Karvenagar which is almost into the outskirts of Pune, but that doesn’t seem to be a very big problem, as it is easily accessible. Its a 15-20 minute walk from Karve Road where loads of PMT buses drop you. But the walk might become tiring during summers and two-wheelers are always more preferable.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Infrastructure :</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The campus is big and nice to look at. It houses another 8 to 10 sister institutes like the architecture and the management college. Talking about Cummins College, the IT and Mechanical sections have separate buildings just to themselves. The other departments, though don't separate blocks, they are sufficiently big. Labs, classrooms and library are well-furnished and only a few grumble about anything that's out of place here. Hostel facility is made available by the college itself and it can accommodate 950 students. The hostel rent is about Rs. 45,000/- per year.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Fees :</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Rs. 75,141/ year</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Faculty :</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Students say that different branches have contrasting faculties. The IT and Instrumentation faculty is supposedly good, but the EXTC faculty supposedly has a majority of new professors with little experience and students often complain that they ‘suppress the students’ and aren’t too friendly either.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Attendance :</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cummins College of Engineering for Women is very strict in terms of attendance. To quote a student, you have to ‘attend every single lecture from FE to BE’, failing which you’ll be given assignments to write. Although the consequences don't seem to be too bad, it is too difficult and requires a lot of courage to land up in that situation in the first place.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Crowd :</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The crowd is pretty good. Most students are well-behaved and quite cooperative. In spite of this being a girls college, they do participate in a lot of extra curricular activities (which excludes gossip :) )</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Hangouts :</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are quite a few hangouts around. Durga café is pretty famous, and Crispy Crunchy, Red Chillies, Caves, Food Express are some more names you’ll commonly hear.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Canteen :</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The canteen is common for all the colleges in the campus and it doesn't suffice. The food is pretty decent. Its very very reasonable, and specializes in Chinese food.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Festivals :</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cummins College of Engineering for Women holds department-specific technical festivals which is intra-college and participants from other colleges are not allowed. However, the cultural festival, Gandhar, held in February is "rocking" says one student.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Placements :</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Fantastic placement records, with more than 80% of the students getting placed. Big names like Microsoft, Google, Texas Instruments, Morgan Stanley, Mercedes and Deloitte also visit the campus offering Rs. 10-15L per year, though they pick up only a handful of students. Major recruiters are Accenture, Wipro, Symentec, Zensar, TCS, Tata Motors and the average salary is decent 3.5 to 4 lakhs a year</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Verdict :</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cummins College of Engineering for Women is a great college, and could mean much more exposure and opportunity for girls to participate and excel in a lot of extracurricular activities as there is no competition from the boys. Great experience for girls who don't mind the absence of guys around, although many hook up with one of the guys from a nearby college.</p>
